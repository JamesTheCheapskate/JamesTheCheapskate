- 👋 Hi, I’m @JamesTheCheapskate.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Japanese (and also Git which I actually need to learn so two birds here).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Brutal Alice - The Hundred day's war by working on the English translation.
- 📫 How to reach me: If you need to, you already know how.  If you're a random person, for now, I might see a post on the Steam discussion for Brutal Alice.
